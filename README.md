# TasveerConnect

Welcome to TasveerConnect - where memories meet innovation!

## About

TasveerConnect is a revolutionary project born out of the creative minds at HackEDCode 2.0, hosted during Elysian 2.0, the annual DesTech Fest of GGSIPU EDC. Our mission is to transform the way you share memories with your loved ones.

## What We Do

At TasveerConnect, we leverage cutting-edge facial recognition technology to streamline the process of sharing photos after gatherings, parties, and special events. No more scrolling through your camera roll or manually sending images to individual contacts. Our intelligent system does the heavy lifting for you.

## Features

- **Facial Recognition:** Our advanced facial recognition technology automatically identifies individuals in your photos.
- **Automated Sharing:** Once uploaded, our system directly mails or WhatsApps the images to the people recognized in them.
- **Effortless Connectivity:** Stay effortlessly connected with your family and friends by sharing memories with ease.
